# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/mint-mandala.js
```

```

one struct of 4 uint8s w 55 saved coords =>  1357805 gas units
one array of uint256 w 64 saved coords =>     201100 gas units
```
